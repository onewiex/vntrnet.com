                    Debt</span
                  ><br />If your public company has investor debt, affiliate or
                  non-affiliate debt reflected on its balance sheet as a
                  liability, VentureNet Capital Group, Inc. is interested in
                  purchasing this debt. If you are an officer or employee of a
                  public company and have deferred your compensation, VNTN is
                  interested in purchasing your debt. In both cases, VNTN will
                  purchase the debt dollar for dollar and in the case of
                  corporate debt, make a direct investment in the public company
                  equal to the amount of debt VNTN purchases. To qualify:<br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>Corporate debt must be 2 years old</li>
                    <li>Deferred Compensation must be 1 year old</li>
                    <li>Stock must trade $25,000 per day in volume</li>

                    >Corporate Financing Fueling Growth</span
                  ><br />
                  VentureNet Capital Group, Inc. can provide the capital to fuel
                  your companyâ€™s growth. We build strong relationships by
                  helping you build a solid corporate foundation. VNTN can
                  customize any type of:<br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>Equity Financing</li>
                    <li>Debt Financing</li>
                    <li>Receivable Financing</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br /><a name="pipe"></a
                  ><span class="Header">PIPE Financing</span><br />(Private
                  Investments in Public Equity). We arrange financing for public
                  companies using PIPE financing from $1 million to $100 million
                  depending on the liquidity of the stock. In addition, we
                  provide capital using non-recourse stock loans to
                  non-affiliates with a LTV of 75% to 85%.<br /><br />
                  <a name="stock-loans"></a
                  ><span class="Header">Stock Loans</span><br />Our stock loans
                  do not require registration statements, and there are no
                  credit checks, no tax returns, no personal guarantees and no
                  margin calls. Stock loans are one method to manage the risk of
                  owning stock. If the price of the stock appreciates during the
                  term of the loan the borrower may capture some of this
                  appreciation. If the price of the stock goes down the borrower
                  has the option of walking away from the loan without any
                  negative impact on their credit.<br /><br />
                  Non-affiliate shareholders pledge their stock as security for
                  the loan and in turn loan it back to the public company and
                  receive an interest-bearing note, more stock, option and
                  warrants. The public company receives the capital they need to
                  operate without dilution.<br /><br />
                  <a name="nontox"></a
                  ><span class="Header">Equity Lines of Credit</span><br />
                  Our non-toxic equity lines of credit have a floor price so
                  there are no "toxic death spirals. We work with the company to
                  make sure they receive the capital they need to succeed.
                  Discounts if any are determined by the liquidity of the
                  stock.<br /><br />
                  <a name="aged-debt"></a><span class="Header">Aged Debt</span
                  ><br />We provide capital to public companies by purchasing
                  their aged debt (2 years or older) and we pay dollar for
                  dollar. This allows the company to secure financing and clean
                  up their balance sheet. We also make a direct investment into
                  the public company equal to the amount of debt we purchase.<br /><br />
                  <span class="Header">Asset-Based financing</span><br />
                  We provide capital secured with equipment, accounts
                  receivables, free trading stock and other liquid assets.
                  Funding in some cases can be in 10 days.<br /><br />
                  In all cases of financing the stock of the public company must
                  trade $25,000.00 or more per day to qualify.<br /><br />
